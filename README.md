**NavigationTransitions** is a library that integrates seamlessly with SwiftUI's **Navigation** views, allowing complete customization over **push and pop transitions**!

The library is fully compatible with:

- **`NavigationView`** (iOS 13, 14, 15)
- **`NavigationStack`** (iOS 16)

## Overview

Instead of reinventing entire navigation components in order to customize its transitions, `NavigationTransitions` ships with a simple modifier that can be applied directly to SwiftUI's very own first-party navigation component.

### The Basics

#### iOS 13+

```swift
NavigationView {
  // ...
}
.navigationViewStyle(.stack)
.navigationTransition(.slide)
```

#### iOS 16

```swift
NavigationStack {
  // ...
}
.navigationTransition(.slide)
```

---

The API is designed to resemble that of built-in SwiftUI Transitions for maximum **familiarity** and **ease of use**.

You can apply **custom animations** just like with standard SwiftUI transitions:

```swift
.navigationTransition(
    .fade(.in).animation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.3))
)
```

You can **combine** them:

```swift
.navigationTransition(
    .slide.combined(with: .fade(.in))
)
```

And you can **dynamically** choose between transitions based on logic:

```swift
.navigationTransition(
    reduceMotion ? .fade(.in).animation(.linear) : .slide(.vertical)
)
```

### Transitions

The library ships with some **standard transitions** out of the box:

- [`default`](Sources/NavigationTransition/Default.swift)
- [`fade(_:)`](Sources/NavigationTransition/Fade.swift)
- [`slide(axis:)`](Sources/NavigationTransition/Slide.swift)

In addition to these, you can create fully [**custom**](Demo/Demo/Swing.swift) transitions in just a few lines of SwiftUI-like code!

```swift
struct Swing: NavigationTransition {
    var body: some NavigationTransition {
        Slide(axis: .horizontal)
        MirrorPush {
            let angle = 70.0
            let offset = 150.0
            OnInsertion {
                Rotate(.degrees(-angle))
                Offset(x: offset)
                Opacity()
                Scale(0.5)
            }
            OnRemoval {
                Rotate(.degrees(angle))
                Offset(x: -offset)
            }
        }
        OnPop {
            OnRemoval {
                SendToBack()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Check out the [**documentation**](Documentation/Custom-Transitions.md) to learn more about custom transitions.

The [**Demo**](Demo) app showcases some of these transitions in action.

### Interactivity

A sweet additional feature is the ability to override the behavior of the **pop gesture** on the navigation view:

```swift
.navigationTransition(.slide, interactivity: .pan) // full-pan screen gestures!
```

This even works to override its behavior while maintaining the **default system transition** in iOS:

```swift
.navigationTransition(.default, interactivity: .pan) // ✨
```

## Documentation

The documentation for releases and `main` are available here:

- [`main`](https://swiftpackageindex.com/davdroman/swiftui-navigation-transitions/main/documentation/navigationtransitions)
- [0.2.0](https://swiftpackageindex.com/davdroman/swiftui-navigation-transitions/0.2.0/documentation/navigationtransitions)

The repository also contains [**documentation**](Documentation/Custom-Transitions.md) covering how to set up your own **custom transitions**.

## Community

Feel free to **post questions**, **ideas**, or any **cool transitions** you build in the [**Discussions**](https://github.com/davdroman/swiftui-navigation-transitions/discussions) section!

I sincerely hope you enjoy using this library as much as I enjoyed building it ❤️
