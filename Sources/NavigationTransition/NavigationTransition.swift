/// It is designed to handle both push and pop operations for a pair of views in a given navigation stack transition,
/// and is usually composed of smaller isolated transitions of type `AtomicTransition`, which act as building blocks.
///
/// Although the library ships with a set of predefined transitions (e.g. ``Slide``, one can also create
/// entirely new, fully customizable transitions by conforming to this protocol.
