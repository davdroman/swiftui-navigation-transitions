/// This protocol variant is used to implement transitions that need to interact with raw UIKit transitioning entities.

/// - Warning: Usage of this initializer is highly discouraged unless you know what you're doing.
/// Conform to ``NavigationTransition`` instead to ensure correct transition behavior.

    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - Animator: The `Animator` object used for the transition. Attach animations or completion blocks to it.
    ///   - Operation: The ``TransitionOperation``. Possible values are `push` or `pop`. It's recommended that you
    ///   customize the behavior of your transition based on this parameter.
    ///   - Context: The raw `UIViewControllerContextTransitioning` instance of the transition coordinator.
